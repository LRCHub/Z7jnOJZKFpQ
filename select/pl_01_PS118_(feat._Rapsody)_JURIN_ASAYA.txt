Aight lemme talk to 'em
Destination out of this world
It's space travel
New heights I'm seeing new lights
I change levels
More space this race an exhibition
XG on an expedition
Light speed go the extra distance
Shooting stars so when you blink
Then I bet you miss it
I want the galaxy baby
You want the recognition
Everything is moving the way that I plan it
I'm cutting transmission yeah
Make the planets shift wit my gift
I'm an alien
Birthed by the sun See the skin on me radiant
Everything I spit is for absorption in your
cranium
Surface level rap
I ain't never been as lame as them
Grammy ray rap
Put light to the mic yeah
Distance between me and them
I'm a light year
5.88 trillion miles off 'em
Still send directions back home
For the lost ones
Proceed with caution
'Cause the G's could make you nauseous
XG's a group of Martians
You know when I rocket
You get blasted in the process
No nonsense
And they know that the flow cosmic
You rap or not?
I'm just floating on a track
Like an astronaut
And I'm dunking on your planet when I pass the
rock
I gotta vision when I drop it
So you gotta listen
Makin' a movie like Apollo missions
Know what it cost me
Know what it cost us
Gotta bring the heat
This a Big Bang process
Culmination reached
They seeing a meridian
I get around like Pac I be traveling
They don't want no Star Wars
They don't want to battle with a quasar
Send 'em black hole that's a favor
Frequency high
They don't even cross my radar
Impact looking like the moon
All these craters
Travel too close to the glow
That's where the rays are
You set the bar too low
That's why we raise ours
7 dots on your screen
Like stars gotta claim ours
I just do what I do
And our dues yo we paid ours
Oxygen level low
Vapors is all I'm breathing in
Had to hit up Rapsody
The queen no bohemian
8 bars pass off with ease so convenient
I see the play Earth is feeling crowded
So I needed space
Get off my wave
Get off my wave
Volatile don't follow rules
I don't behave
From my thoughts to my style
Sharper than a blade
I'm a different type of grade
And I meant that with shade
Anointed by the Cosmo
You can't relate so
Get off my wave
Get off my wave
Get off my wave let me be
This is higher intellect
From an legend MC rap
Everytime I go in I feel anointed
I'm like Christopher Nolan on a Neumann
The way I push it back to the limit
Seems like I'm double jointed
I been appointed my employment
Is recording these tracks
Just for your enjoyment
I'm excited hope you feel the raps
Punching like Tyson is science
I'm Neil de grass
Spaced out but I'm grounded
Like I'm near the grass
Do this with a passion you see the flash
I write like fire fighters
I fill the draft
